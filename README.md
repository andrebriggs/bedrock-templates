If you don't want to use a variable group you can set ENV VAR *een secure ones) in your custom Bedrock build agent,

POwersful user can bring all their tool in a custom Bedrock build agent.

Customers are on their own between AKS (infra creation) and Azure Devops (orchestration)

What we are enabling --> AZDO GitOps Library

    How to how extension? 


Shell scripts that are based on ENV VARs can be easily tested.

Stays true to OO programming model

Encapsulation - business logic specific data and functions are packaged
Decoupling - 
composition - Templates provide object composition by making "has a" relation very clear. A container build strategy has multiple options. Templates suppor inheritance models for variables
polymorphism - Strng separation of concerns


The templatizing makes it easier for someone to take what we are doing and massage it to their needs. The current model doesn't invite people to change what has been scaffolding

This makes "upgrading" tedious to teh point that folks may not want to do it
